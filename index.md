Hey, I'm Mohamed Al Ali. Welcome to my place.

I bring software ideas to life. I believe that throughout the years, I have gained the necessary skills and abilities to manage and develop software projects. I am also very interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which is an area I'm very new to and would love to explore more during my future studies.
